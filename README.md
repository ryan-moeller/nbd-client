## NOTICE

See https://github.com/ryan-moeller/kernel-nbd-client for a new and improved
NBD client for FreeBSD.

## Synopsis

The Network Block Device is a Linux-originated lightweight block access
protocol that allows one to export a block device to a client.

This client is designed to run on top of FreeBSD's GEOM Gate device driver,
keeping the network client in a userland daemon rather than in a kernel
module.

Casper is used to sandbox the DNS lookup of the server host, and Capsicum
is used to limit the capabilities of the client once connected.

Messages are logged via syslog, and to stdout and stderr when running
interactively.

The client immediately daemonizes unless passed the `-f` flag, in which
case it remains running in the foreground.

## Caveats

* Most protocol extensions are not currently supported.
* Manual control (listing, naming, numbering, removal) of the device nodes
  is not yet provided by this tool.

## Usage Example

Connect to an NBD server and print the name of the new device on stdout:

```
nbd-client 192.168.1.101
```

Connect specifying a hostname and port number:

```
nbd-client nbd.storage.internal-domain.net 10809
```

Connect using a UNIX-domain socket:

```
nbd-client /path/to/nbd-server.socket
```
Connect to an export named `xyz`:

```
nbd-client -n xyz 10.2
```

You can then use this device as a regular disk device.  For example, create
a ZFS pool named `foo` backed by the NBD storage attached to `ggate0`.

```
zpool create foo ggate0
```

Use the `ggatec` utility to list all attached GEOM Gate devices.  These may
not all be NBD devices:

```
ggatec list
```

Use the `ggatec` utility to force removal of the GEOM Gate device unit `0`,
which corresponds to the device named `ggate0`:

```
ggatec destroy -f -u 0
```

## Compiling

```
make
make install # (optional)
```

Note: This project expects to be compiled with BSD make, not GNU make.

## To Do

* list exports (work started)
* connect to multiple/all exports on a server (spawn a thread per export?)
* configuration file
* rc scripts
* option to drop to a less privileged user?
* parallel connections to an export

## Bugs

Please report them along with steps to reproduce.

## Motivation

Scaleway offers high-density dedicated servers using NBD to attach storage
to each machine.  FreeBSD lacks an NBD client, so Scaleway does not support
FreeBSD.  This project aims to implement an NBD client so that Scaleway can
offer FreeBSD on their servers.
